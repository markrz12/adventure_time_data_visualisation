# Adventure Time Inspired Data Visualization

Kingdoms from the world of “ Adventure Time” were used as inspiration to create consistent stylesheets for data visualization. The Kingdom of Candy, the Kingdom of Fire, the Kingdom of Ice and the Kingdom of Sugar played a key role as the main themes and aesthetic templates for these style sheets. The project aimed to create attractive designs that capture the unique characteristics and atmosphere of each kingdom.
