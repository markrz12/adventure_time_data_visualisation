# Adventure Time Inspired Data Visualization

Kingdoms from the world of *Adventure Time* were used as inspiration to create consistent stylesheets for data visualization. Candy Kingdom, Fire Kingdom, Ice Kingdom and the Lumpy Space Kingdom played a key role as the main themes and aesthetic templates for these style sheets. The project aimed to create attractive designs that capture the unique characteristics and atmosphere of each kingdom.
